# redirector
Redirector is a chrome extension which redirects your urls to ones of your choice. (i.e. facebook.com ---> nytimes.com) 
The process of internet surfing, once begun, often spirals into oblivion. However,
if the starting point to your surfing were more intentional, then your surfing session could produce much greater value. 
So next time your hand twitches and types in "fb.com", you can start getting up to speed on world politics instead.

To install:

-Download files

-In chrome/more tools/extensions, click "load unpacked extension" and upload unzipped folder.

-Icon will appear in toolbar. Enter the redirections of your choice!
